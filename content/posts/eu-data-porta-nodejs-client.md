Planning to make an open data GraphQL server, it was natural to first build a small abstraction wrapper which can be re-used in other projects. Basically, the [odp library][1] I'm going to talk about is just a simplified client for fetching data from the EU Open Data Portal.

### Getting the library

When you have [node.js][2], the module can be installed by npm:

```bash
$ npm install odp
```

### Library API

The API of the module is pretty simple:

```js
// Get a range of the whole list of datasets:
odp.getDatasets({ query: { limit: 100, offset: 1 } }).then(data => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

Currently, there are 4 methods which match the brief information from the [developers' corner][3]. Methods are: `getDatasets()`, `getTags()`, `getDataset()` and `datasetSearch()`. It could be that there are more options than that in the API, but these are all I know so far as user of the website.

An [Examples section][4] is included in the README file for further details.

### Resources

Suggestions and pull requests are welcome at the [github page of the project][5].

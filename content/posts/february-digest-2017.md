After my [January digest](/january-digest-2017), I got feedback from a precious reader that these stories must be toilet-friendly, so I’ll keep it short, directly to the essence :)

### Productivity

Without a question, the first thing coming to my mind in this month is the set of small changes I made with regards to my typing habits.

[Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en) turned out to be really useful utility in my daily work on my [x220t](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series-tablet/x220tablet/). Together with the [clit mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_stick), browsing becomes more straight-forward, even when clicking is inevitable. Yes, I feel more comfortable in vim after having vimium in my life, but I still prefer to [be pragmatic at work](https://www.toptal.com/php/how-to-be-efficient-in-phpstorm). In the end, it all comes to wiring up an effective association between the brain and the computer which boils down to having [effective typing habits](http://www.ratatype.com/learn/).

Another big discovery for me this month was the [imagemagick’s](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) `[conver](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php)` [cli tools](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php). After spending more than 30 minutes of trying to make a [screenshot of gmail message for a tweet](https://twitter.com/kalinchernev/status/835053566632964097) and not managing to convert paged pdf into a single continuous image, that command in the CLI really did magic:

```bash
$ convert in.pdf -append out.png
```

### GraphQL

I managed to spend few hours with this technology this month and I will remember few highlights as a result of that:

- [My short sharing session](https://medium.com/@kalin.chernev/the-guide-to-learn-graphql-i-wish-i-found-few-months-go-97f9d9ca6f12#.7ss1zopsu) got more than 1000 visits on day 1, scoring for more than 1.4k at present moment.
- [GraphQL docs](https://graphql-docs.com/) got published by [Scaphold](https://scaphold.io/)
- [GraphQL voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager) got published by [APIs.guru](https://medium.com/@apis.guru)

The technology is getting further traction and community love.

### Resources

Although there have been numerous resources coming by on a daily basis, these are the most prominent to my humble opinion:

- [Open source guides](https://opensource.guide/) by github
- [Dev books](http://www.dev-books.com/) summary based on stackoverflow

Enjoy, and keep reading and writing code for pleasure! :)

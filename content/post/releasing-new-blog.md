It's a fact - I moved my blog from [Medium](https://medium.com/@kalin.chernev)
to [github.com](https://kalinchernev.github.io/)!

As previously mentioned [last year](/holiday-digest-2016)
and [last month](/march-digest-2017), I've been considering moving away from
Medium as the platform is continuously shifting focus to vendors and businesses.
So, here it is - yet another blog, this time containing most of the content
previously published, just to make sure it does not disappear during the
transformation of Medium.

### Technology stack

Here's a brief overview of what's behind this blog:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

That's all, generated by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).

The layout and design are not too different than before, rather, there are
some tweaks made on the way:

- Print-friendly, make it easy to read when pages are exported as PDF.
- PWA - you can "install" the site as an app and read content offline
- Code is highlighted

Also, comments are integrated with [Disqus](https://disqus.com/). I think
this is a particularly good improvement which maintains the community-oriented
recommendation and interaction flows.

### Conclusions

With this new place to write, I plan to continue sharing about various experiments
and tools I'm working on in the spirit of [Digital Beer](https://medium.com/digital-beer/digital-beer-2a3fc5a12006).

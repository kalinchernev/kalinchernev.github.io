Hello and welcome to my github pages! This is the place where I share my personal knowledge and experience about technology.

I've gained my professional experience through more than a decate of dedicated learning and hands-on work. I've been contributing to various projects mostly as a full-stack web developer with focus on delivering business value and results.

JavaScript has been the primary tool I've been using because it's the most versatile language and platform at the moment. For example, these are some of types of projects I've successfully delivered:

- Jamstack websites: Gatsby.js (React.js, GraphQL), Netlify and Netlify CMS
- Single page applications: React.js, AngularJS (v1) and Vue.js (v2)
- Test automation with cypress, jest, puppeteer and selenium/webdriver
- Data lakes: Serverless, Elasticsearch and AWS JavaScript SDK
- UI components libraries
- Restful APIs: express and Swagger/OpenAPI
- Chat bots: Microsoft LUIS, Facebook, using their corresponding SDKs
- Command line applications (CLIs)

My aim is to provide solutions which are user-friendly and with good code quality.

I believe that experimentation and hands-on attemps with technology are vital for any type of learning experience, so I do quite some of those. I frequently don't have the opportunity to use a given tool which I find interesting or useful for my full-time work. That's why a few of the articles here are based on experimentation with tools I don't know quite well, but want to.

Check out the [tags](/tags) page for quick reference/overview of all the topics covered within this website. I hope you find them interesting and useful! Any suggestions are welcome in <a href="https://github.com/kalinchernev/kalinchernev.github.io/issues" target="_blank">the repository hosting the site</a>.

The documentation points to the <a href=\\\"http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/\\\">jsonplaceholder</a> example, but surely <a href=\\\"http://hook.io/\\\">hook.io</a> or a similar cloud service will work just fine. Just keep it simple and working‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe main idea of using this tool is to move fast and effectively.</p>\\n<p>Another option for generating a server on top of an existing specification is the <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-server\\\">swagger-server</a> package which also integrates with express.js, however does not necessarily provide the ready filters, sorts, etc. that json-server does.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"additional-ideas\\\"><a href=\\\"#additional-ideas\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Additional ideas</h3>\\n<p>I personally separated both tools in 2 repositories for the following reasons:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The mock API server can be managed and deployed independently</li>\\n<li>Data from the mock server can be easily fetched from the github pages documentation, as JSON Server comes with CORS enabled by default</li>\\n<li>This same mock API server can be just thrown away when the real server comes into place to work with the documentation and/or application</li>\\n<li>It‚Äôs also good to have the documentation repository separate to make it easier to manage in a similar way as the server. Good example is how both swagger ui, swagger editor and ReDoc are integrated into a single project focusing on developing specification and documentation</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\\"further-notes\\\"><a href=\\\"#further-notes\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Further notes</h3>\\n<p>That was a brief article sharing some love about open source projects which deserve an applause for being simple and effective helpers for developers.</p>\\n<p>If this article gets any positive feedback, I will make a follow-up story to this one showing few tips to improve the workflow of editing and publishing specification to documentation to a working API.</p>\\n<p>At any case, the search of more effective and well-integrated API prototyping, documentation and deployment continues.</p>\"}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"prototyping-apis-open-api-specification\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/prototyping-apis-open-api-specification.json\n// module id = 563\n// module chunks = 78022607812443"],"sourceRoot":""}

For me, that’s uncomfortable since we speak about a phone which,\nalthough the not-so-high-end-specs, has always been practical enough for me.\nI researched the latest phones in a similar model range, and my conclusion was\nthat this time I will have to find a way to tweak the phone a bit, rather than\nbuying a new one because “this one is getting old”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"losing-a-few-kilos-is-easy\"><a href=\"#losing-a-few-kilos-is-easy\" aria-label=\"losing a few kilos is easy permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Losing a few kilos is easy</h3>\n<p>In the beginning, cleaning some app cache, removing unnecessary apps and things\nlike this helped a bit to speed up the performance, but the gains were mainly\nin the freed storage space. For example, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.lite&#x26;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Facebook Lite</a>\ncombines both main and messenger apps in less than 2MB, which is x70 times less\nthan 84MB + 56MB for both otherwise. And btw, the user experience is still good.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-factory-reset\"><a href=\"#the-factory-reset\" aria-label=\"the factory reset permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The factory reset</h3>\n<p>In ALE-L21 there are regular updates to the official EMUI. Normally, making a\nhard reset means a clean start in a comparatively safe way after a backup.\nThough, I had bad experience figuring that the factory version of Google Play Services\nunder the last official update of the EMUI was simply <a href=\"Cannot%20connect%20or%20communicate%20with%20Google%20servers\">unable to log me in</a>.\nParticularly nasty when I needed to install the Google Authenticator\nto be able to pass 2FA to a service which I had to demo during the day. The way\nI managed to solve this problem was installing the latest version of the service\nfrom <a href=\"https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-play-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the mirror</a>.</p>\n<p>The factory reset was a huge performance gain. After it, even the welcome screen\ndoes not freeze or slow down any more. Together with cache reset, the phone feels\nlike new.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mobile-operator-drama\"><a href=\"#mobile-operator-drama\" aria-label=\"mobile operator drama permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Mobile operator drama</h3>\n<p>Interestingly enough, other problems I had, such as not being able to share mobile\ndata, appeared to be purely operator-specific.

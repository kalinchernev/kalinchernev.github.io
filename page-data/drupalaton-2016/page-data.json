It is one of the most exciting yearly Drupal events in Europe, organized by the local community. It gathers hundreds of contributors who collaborate on Drupal issues, share knowledge and have fun together :)</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed this year’s event since it covered a lot of my favorite topics. (discussed shortly after) Good sessions, pleasant talks with the community, and also — a lot of new things to learn. The event took place at the shore of the biggest warm-water lake in Europe, at Lake Balaton.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ME6rgg3pXT8oid14R5RNVg.jpeg\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"sessions\"><a href=\"#sessions\" aria-label=\"sessions permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Sessions</h3>\n<p>Sure enough, sessions were covering important <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Drupal 8</a> features. There were several tracks, as well as sprints, where participants were able to collaborate.</p>\n<p>I visited mainly the workshops related to the <a href=\"http://buytaert.net/a-roadmap-for-making-drupal-more-api-first\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">API-first initiative</a>. This is a futuristic initiative, involving many JavaScript tools and modern concepts and practices for building service-oriented apps, not only websites.</p>\n<p>It’s a vital initiative for Drupal as a platform for the future. Presently, Drupal is one of the best systems for content modelling, querying, and building websites in general. This means that normal people can make websites with complex information structures with very little or no programming.</p>\n<p>The API-first initiative could potentially take Drupal into a place where <strong>the content modelling and querying becomes data modelling and querying, enabling non-developers to build complex APIs for the next generation apps.</strong></p>\n<p>Apart from these, there were also sessions about Drupal-specific modules being upgraded between Drupal 7 and 8. In overall, I think we’ll see more “good stuff” of <a href=\"https://symfony.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Symfony</a>, PHP OOP, design patterns, etc topics during next Drupal events.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workshops\"><a href=\"#workshops\" aria-label=\"workshops permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Workshops</h3>\n<p>This is my humble list of highlighted sessions I focused on.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://2016.drupalaton.hu/schedule#speaker-166\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>REST APIs</strong></a> by Pieter Frenssen (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/pfrenssen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">pfrenssen</a>)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4o8SJ8Q9EhrUt4fkz8DKpQ.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>Well-formed, step-by-step guide, covering all important concepts of having Drupal as both server and/or a client in <a href=\"http://www.restapitutorial.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">REST API architectures</a>. If you want to skip the details in this section, check <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/developing/api/8/rest#practical\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Drupal REST API docs</a> which covers great amount of information around the topic.</p>\n<p>The beginning was a general information about what REST actually is. This included status codes, methods, design patterns, etc.</p>\n<p>After presenting the basics, the next step was to use Drupal as a client, fetching data from <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/docs/api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">drupal.org REST API</a> and displaying it in a block.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hechoendrupal.gitbooks.io/drupal-console/content/en/commands/generate-plugin-block.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Creating a block with Drupal Console</a> was super-easy. That was a really neat way to demonstrate injecting the <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal.php/function/Drupal%3A%3AhttpClient/8.2.x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http_client service</a> via the cli from the <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!core.api.php/group/container/8.2.x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">container</a>.</p>\n<p>There was also a demo of using the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/rest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">core REST API module</a>, which transforms Drupal into an API server. <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/restui\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">REST UI module</a> was demonstrated as a site builders’ tool to manage the configurations which are otherwise <a href=\"https://www.chapterthree.com/blog/custom-restful-api-drupal-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">managed through .yml files</a>. Here, it’s important to note, that the endpoints of the REST API are controllers. Developers have the freedom to choose which format of data to return and via which components. For example, one can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/symfony/http-foundation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Symfony’s HttpFoundation</a> and its JsonResponse instance.</p>\n<p>In short, there was a lot of good advice, both about REST APIs in general, and Drupal-specific implementations, in combination with third-party tools and components.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://2016.drupalaton.hu/schedule#speaker-171\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Headless Drupal</strong></a> by Ruben Teijeiro (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/rteijeiro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">rteijeiro</a>)</p>\n<p>Even though I did not attend the workshop, it was still part of the Drupal API-first series of topics. <a href=\"https://github.com/rteijeiro/headless-drupal8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Code of the session</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://2016.drupalaton.hu/schedule#speaker-106\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Progressive web apps</strong></a> by Théodore Biadala (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/nod_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">nod_</a>)</p>\n<p>That was an intermediate-level session. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Promises</a> were in the core of all code snippets and demonstrations. Highlight APIs: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Fetch API</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Cache</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Service Workers</a>, and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Web APIs</a> in general. The main idea was to demonstrate how modern web APIs can be used to build web apps, having functionalities very similar to native apps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/theodoreb/pwa-workshop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The repository</a> of the workshop is public, so go and check it for further details in case you’re interested into the interface implementations.</p>\n<p>It’s interesting to note the example of <a href=\"https://github.com/theodoreb/pwa-workshop/blob/master/js/1-promise.js#L12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">promise-based</a> <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/756722#behaviors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">behaviors system</a>.

It was about the <a href=\"http://graphql.org/docs/getting-started/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Facebook’s GraphQL</a>, which developers were ready to understand, after touching upon REST APIs, JavaScript Frameworks, knowing what is a server and a client in general in the previous sessions.</p>\n<p>I personally enjoyed the workshop. In fact, I was even able follow along with the live coding on the main screen. It was also nice that it made a clear association between specification and language implementation. This means that same concepts of data architecture were demonstrated and practices with <a href=\"https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">JavaScript</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Youshido/GraphQL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">PHP</a>.</p>\n<p>In the first part, the <a href=\"https://github.com/graphql/swapi-graphql\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Star Wars API</a> was used with the <a href=\"http://graphql.org/swapi-graphql/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GraphiQL</a> — a hands-on tutorial to <a href=\"http://slides.com/sebastiansiemssen/graphql-meets-drupal-dd#/3/7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">understand the basic concepts</a> like queries, fragments, variables, sub selections, etc.</p>\n<p>Second was the usage of node.js app with express, express-graphql, graphiql, graphql and other popular modules to transpile ES6 code. In this playground, the building part started. Various types were used: GraphQLSchema, GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLString, GraphQLInt, GraphQLNonNull, GraphQLList, etc. That was my first time to actually write something working out of the <a href=\"https://learngraphql.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">learngraphql.com</a> online tutorials.</p>\n<p>There was a demo of Relay in-between, as a bonus, to grab a general understanding of the additional features provided on top of the fundamental specification.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tpPTqCyZnfPqhb1er6ECpw.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>After the GraphQL implementation in JavaScript was getting convenient, then we continued using the same concepts, but to build a server in PHP and the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/graphql\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Drupal GraphQL module</a>. Sure enough, the approach was similar, but this time extending SchemaProviderBase and implementing framework-specific EntityTypeManager (<a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Entity%21EntityTypeManagerInterface.php/interface/EntityTypeManagerInterface/8.2.x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Interface</a>) to manage <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2192175\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Content Entity</a> items.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusions\"><a href=\"#conclusions\" aria-label=\"conclusions permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusions</h3>\n<p>The event was awesome, the people were great, and the sessions were truly useful.

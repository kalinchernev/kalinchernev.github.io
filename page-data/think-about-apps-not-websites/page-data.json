For example, managing our user data and documents synchronization in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the cloud</a> is a vital skill you have to master. This way, you can take advantage of the technological opportunities of keeping your information safe and available anywhere you have a browser and an internet connection.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs,_Sheets_and_Slides\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Google docs</a> got available to us a decade ago, and Microsoft followed with their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneDrive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">OneDrive</a> few years later. So, regardless of the device (tablet, laptop, PC, etc.) we can work with our documents through our browser, AND have a safe backup of our work. Not taking advantage of cloud technologies to have synchronized backup of our important documents is a missed opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Making a website that shows only information is a missed opportunity.</strong></p>\n<p>Why is that? Well, simple — the problems we are solving today are different than the problems we were solving 10 years ago. Even if the criticism of the accelerated change were true, why would we encounter so many examples of transformation we did not anticipate with this speed?</p>\n<p>Another example higher user expectation: being able to work with mobile applications offline. A decade ago, a website was a good solution to having an online presence, i.e. having a business card, etc. Probably printing pages was ok. However, today, <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/3145946/streaming-services/you-can-finally-watch-netflix-offline-now.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Netflix offline capabilities</a> or editing documents in Google Drive offline mode are making customers happy, because users are mobile.</p>\n<p>In similar conditions, building a website to just share information is not something special any more, because users expect a whole different, more engaging digital experience — think about SMS notifications. They were standard some years ago, but not anymore. Today, push notifications are everywhere. And there is no way that trend goes down, as the future connected world will involve even higher amount of notifications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"web-apps\"><a href=\"#web-apps\" aria-label=\"web apps permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Web apps</h3>\n<p>“Web apps” is probably something you already know.

What are the repetitive elements of my web pages? Normally these are the navigation and its surroundings. All these become the “shell”, being cached on the device for easy access, and the content is dynamically fetched when available.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dEvx7lPNJT-r-tKjqvAXxg.png\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Image credits</a></p>\n<p>In order to implement this strategy for saving resources, one must know how to use the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Cache API</a> through a service worker. The API can also be accessed through the global <code class=\"language-text\">window</code> object as well, but working through a SW, we can “hook” into the events in the worker’s life-cycle, i.e. we can validate cache when network connection toggles.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-servic-worker\"><a href=\"#creating-a-servic-worker\" aria-label=\"creating a servic worker permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Creating a servic worker</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rich offline experiences, periodic background syncs, push notifications — functionality that would normally require a native application — are coming to the web. Service workers provide the technical foundation that all these features rely on. — taken from ”<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Service Workers: an Introduction</a>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In basic terms, the service worker is a proxy layer between your stack (HTML+CSS+JS) and the network. The API of service workers boost the functionality of your otherwise normal web pages.</p>\n<p>A good starting point could be the sample for <a href=\"https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/service-worker/custom-offline-page/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Service Worker Sample: Custom Offline Page Sample</a>. If the amount of code seems too much, have a look at the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/service-worker-libraries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">tools section</a> where some libraries are already published to make these functionalities more accessible. For example, if your project uses a task runner, you can implement <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#install\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">`sw-precache</a>` (<a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/sw-precache/#0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">tutorial</a> is also available ;)</p>\n<p>For me, personally, it was fun to play a bit with the service worker file, not having access to the DOM directly, but yet having a Web API that should communicate with it was an interesting thing. In the end, I used the example code provided in the <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache/tree/master/demo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">demo</a> of <code class=\"language-text\">sw-precache</code> because I’m really lazy.</p>\n<p>By the end of the exercise, I have this branch for <a href=\"https://github.com/kalinchernev/pwa/tree/basics/caching\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the basics of caching the application shell</a>. What I really like as a side-effect of stealing the gulp file of the demo above is that now I have a basic build system. That helps me in generating a comparatively sophisticated service-worker handling the offline behavior of my web app. Also, it gives me a nicely working <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">gh-pages website</a> that can be accessed by anyone over HTTPS on &#x3C;https: kalinchernev.github.io=\"\" pwa=\"\"> This makes me really happy, because of several reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I already have a self-hosted, manageable (easy to update and deploy), modern web app, that looks like a mobile app. It can be viewed and installed on a mobile device, and later opened in a “shell”, i.e. not showing broken pages offline mode.</li>\n<li>Having a task runner like <a href=\"http://gulpjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">gulp</a> opens a door of opportunities to make my development life even easier than before: I can integrate live reload, include any preprocessing of LESS/SASS, can include babel to turn my ES6 code in ES5 for older browsers, etc.</li>\n<li>Using the <code class=\"language-text\">sw-precache</code> even as simple as it is right now, provides me with benefits of easier asset management, as I don’t have to go too much into the details of the Cache API if I don’t want to, and the mechanism of implementing the worker is easier to update in the future, as I believe the project will be well maintained. So, my task for future maintenance will be to re-generate the worker which is already included on the page.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope that you already see more opportunities than before. In particular, next time you want to publish information that is important and useful for your users when, say, they travel, consider these options. Imagine you want to provide accessible guides and documentation — just follow the same steps and provide enhanced experience, I’m sure it’ll pay off.</p>\n<h3 id=\"push-notification\"><a href=\"#push-notification\" aria-label=\"push notification permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Push notification</h3>\n<p>Let me briefly indicate some resources that I consider useful for the topic, without going into details, as this feature is going a bit beyond the browser and won’t be as beginner-friendly as I’d like it to be.

You can bookmark the good ol’ <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#search=push\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">caniuse.com</a> to verify whether an API you want to use is supported natively or you’ll have to search for a shim/polyfill and similar. Of course, there are many existing libraries and frameworks which are already taking developers attention (causing fatigue :)</p>\n<p>Here I speak about experimental features that will change, but I firmly believe that browser vendors are on a good way of collaborating to support native APIs more consistently rapidly in very near future, so these features will be standard before you realize it. Knowing the standards helps you produce more maintainable code and gives you a good idea about the direction of Web, regardless of the popularity and influence of vendor frameworks and libraries.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusions\"><a href=\"#conclusions\" aria-label=\"conclusions permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusions</h3>\n<p>There are simple steps that anyone can take in order to convert their existing websites and web pages in progressive web apps, i.e. pages with HTML+CSS+JavaScript which act like native apps for important functionalities. Installation, caching and push notifications are a growing trend for a reason — they increase user engagement and provide great experience.</p>\n<p>So, during the upcoming holidays, have a look at the following Web APIs, and hopefully play with them, provide more value via your web pages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>create a <code class=\"language-text\">manifest.json</code> file describing your app with its assets</li>\n<li>implement caching for the vital assets necessary when offline</li>\n<li>make a simple push notification for events of new content on your pages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hopefully, using native Web APIs will be fun during this experimentation, as <a href=\"http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Chrome supports a lot of ES6 features</a> and there is no need for you to transpile your code to see immediate results of your work.</p>\n<p>Enjoy and good luck! :)</p>","fields":{"slug":"think-about-apps-not-websites","tagSlugs":["/tag/web-dev/","/tag/mobile/","/tag/java-script/","/tag/progressive-web-apps/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-12-12T22:00:00.000Z","description":null,"tags":["WebDev","mobile","JavaScript","Progressive Web Apps"],"title":"Think about apps, not websites","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"think-about-apps-not-websites"}}}

It was time to realize that no matter if I write JavaScript, PHP or any other programming language, a <strong>good project is not only about the code, but also about the human interaction around the code</strong>.</p>\\n<p>I started joining code sprint, hack jams, issue queues in drupal.org, etc. I had the aha! moment that the human factor around code and software make the coding itself more fun. <strong>By collaborating with other developers in work, community and open source, I learned more times more than my previous level I had of 4 years of solo-learning.</strong></p>\\n<p>I still have so much to learn about the good ways of interaction with other smart developers, but I've already hooked on my strong belief that healthy <strong>collaboration is the best way advance in any technology and project</strong>. It's not just about the software.</p>\\n<p>Even more motivation was the end of the year, my team at the European Commission was awarded to be the best project team :)</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/best-team-cdfab5f8b2e34b9549ef18b7eb6774e7-9c80d.jpeg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 720px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Best team\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/best-team-cdfab5f8b2e34b9549ef18b7eb6774e7-cfe7c.jpeg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/best-team-cdfab5f8b2e34b9549ef18b7eb6774e7-f39eb.jpeg 180w,\\n/static/best-team-cdfab5f8b2e34b9549ef18b7eb6774e7-e1b9c.jpeg 360w,\\n/static/best-team-cdfab5f8b2e34b9549ef18b7eb6774e7-cfe7c.jpeg 720w,\\n/static/best-team-cdfab5f8b2e34b9549ef18b7eb6774e7-9c80d.jpeg 800w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>It's pretty rewarding to be the best :D</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"what-about-2016\\\"><a href=\\\"#what-about-2016\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>What about 2016</h4>\\n<p>For me, 2016 will most probably be the year of community and good service.</p>\\n<p>Community, because it's the hidden jam of happy coding and rapid self-development. Learning is faster, contribution is better, collaboration is fun.</p>\\n<p>Good service, because it's why we developers write code. It's easy to lose focus from that because we have too many paradigms, frameworks and libraries to understand to be productive. Yet, we write code to make good products and provide good service.</p>\\n<p>First come the good product and service, then the good results give the means of winning the time to try and use the latest cutting edge technologies.</p>\"}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"focus-community-good-services\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/focus-community-good-services.json\n// module id = 547\n// module chunks = 219204398460716"],"sourceRoot":""}
